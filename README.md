# SCIMKiller

## What is this?

A button on macOS menu bar to kill the SCIM / SCIM_Extension (and TCIM / TCIM_Extension for Traditional Chinese IME) processes any time when you see a rainbow spinwheel on macOS and all UI get stuck.

## But why?

Embeded Chinese IME on macOS sometimes just stuck the whole system UI for no reason. The only way to fix it right now is to kill the IME process(es).

## But why SCIMKiller?

Terminal apps could be unresponsive as well when the rainbow spinwheel appears, while menubar buttons are __always__ responsive for interaction.

## How to use?

[Download](https://github.com/xiao99xiao/SCIMKiller/releases), unzip, and drag the app to Applications folder.
